# belly-button-challenge

## Overview 
This project creates an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes found in human navels. The dataset reveals that a small number of microbial species are prevalent in over 70% of people, while others are relatively rare.

## Features
- Horizontal Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for a selected individual.
- Bubble Chart: Visualizes all microbial samples for a selected individual, with marker size and color representing abundance and diversity.
- Demographic Info Panel: Displays metadata such as ethnicity, gender, age, and location for the selected individual.
- Dropdown Menu: Enables dynamic selection of individuals to update the charts and demographic info.


## Technologies Used
This project leverages several technologies:

- **HTML/CSS**: Provides the structure and styling for the web application, ensuring a user-friendly layout and design.
- **JavaScript**: Enables dynamic updates and interactivity within the dashboard, such as responding to user input.
- **D3.js**: Facilitates data fetching from the JSON dataset and manipulation of the DOM to display metadata and update charts.
-**Plotly.js**: Powers the creation of the bar and bubble charts, offering rich visualization features and interactivity.
- **Bootstrap**: Ensures the application is responsive and visually consistent across devices with its grid system and utility classes.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Chosen as the preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding, debugging, and managing the project files.
- **GitHub**: Hosts the repository online, allowing for backup, sharing, and documentation hosting, including this README file.
